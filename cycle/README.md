This is a team assignment for a Cycle game program

# Cycle
One of the most classic games that you can play with a friend! Try to win by boxing in your opponent with your cycles trail, but remember that if you hit their 
trail you lose!

# Rules
Cycle is played according to the following rules.

Players can move up, down, left and right...
Player one moves using the W, S, A and D keys.
Player two moves using the I, K, J and L keys.
Each player's trail grows as they move.
Players try to maneuver so the opponent collides with their trail.
If a player collides with their opponent's trail...
    A "game over" message is displayed in the middle of the screen.
    The cycles turn white.
    Players keep moving and turning but don't run into each other.
